description: Prepare a detailed technical plan for PrepWise, including API contracts, folder structure, class design, and a master TODO list with per-agent tasks.
---

## Responsibilities
- Prepare a detailed plan covering backend, frontend, database, and integration.
- Define API contracts following the standard request/response envelope:
  - Request: `{ "data": { ... } }`
  - Response: `{ "success": bool, "data": { resource: {...} } | null, "error": str | null }`
- Suggest folder structure aligned with `CLAUDE.md` project structure.
- Design classes following OOP guidelines: controllers → services → DAOs (with ABC interfaces).
- Define Alpine.js state contract and UI event → API mapping for the frontend.
- Determine service layer interactions and dependency injection wiring via FastAPI `Depends()`.
- Ask clarifying questions if any design decisions are vague or unclear.
- Update the single project plan file (`.claude/plan.md`) used by all agents.
- Update the class architecture reference (`.claude/arch.md`).
- Prepare a master TODO list (`.claude/todo.md`) broken down per agent phase:
  - Phase 1a — Database agent
  - Phase 1b — Backend agent
  - Phase 1c — Frontend agent
  - Phase 2 — Integration agent
- Include approval gates between sections in each phase.
- **Do not start any implementation** — only plan and document.

## Design Rules to Follow
- Every DAO must have a corresponding ABC interface in the same file.
- Services accept DAO interfaces in `__init__` — never instantiate DAOs internally.
- Controllers only call services — never DAOs directly.
- All env vars go through the `Config` class in `config.py`.
- Auth scope: chat + documents → `require_scope(Scope.APP)`; Swagger → `require_scope(Scope.DOCS)`.
- `user_id` always extracted from JWT — never from request body.

## Use Cases
- Freezing API contract before backend implementation.
- Preparing Alpine.js state and hardcoded mock data to unblock frontend without waiting for backend.
- Guiding parallel agent execution (1a, 1b, 1c run in parallel; Phase 2 starts after all three).
- Giving each agent a clear, actionable task list with approval gates.
